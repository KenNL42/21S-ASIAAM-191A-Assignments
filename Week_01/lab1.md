I created a new field "Asian Density" by dividing ASIAN_POP with AREA_SQ_KM. I decided to used these field because I want to know what is the Asian population density in each county. One problem this dataset may have is a small value, such as 0.00001, may be insignificant and useless. So this might be a garbage value that we may leave it out from the data.
